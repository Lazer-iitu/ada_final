# Personal Budgeting & Financial Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes **personal budgeting and saving behavior** using survey data to understand how **behavioral factors** (impulsivity, discretionary spending, saving difficulty) influence financial outcomes beyond income level.

The work focuses on **data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and unsupervised learning** to produce interpretable, real-world insights.

---

## What I Did

* Cleaned and preprocessed survey data (80 respondents, 21 features)
* Engineered behavior-driven financial metrics (savings intensity, discretionary ratio, spending variability)
* Conducted exploratory data analysis with meaningful visualizations
* Applied **K-Means clustering** to segment users into financial behavior profiles
* Interpreted clusters and generated actionable insights

---

## Key Insights

* Income alone does **not** explain saving behavior
* Impulsive spending and discretionary expenses strongly reduce savings efficiency
* Users can be segmented into **distinct behavioral financial profiles**
* Behavioral features outperform demographic features for financial segmentation

---

## Methods & Tools

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **EDA & Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (K-Means, StandardScaler, Silhouette Score)
* **Text Analysis:** WordCloud
* Google Colab

---

## Output

* Cleaned and feature-engineered datasets
* Insight-driven visualizations
* Behavioral clustering with clear interpretation
* Practical recommendations per user segment

---

## Why This Project Matters

Demonstrates the ability to:

* Work with **real, noisy survey data**
* Translate analytics into **business-relevant insights**
* Apply ML for **interpretation**, not just prediction
* Think in terms of **user behavior and decision-making**
